## Mechanical

The mechanical team is mostly about the frame of the satellite and worrying about how to make sure the satellite doesn't
rip itself apart on launch and varies based on the project. Mechanical is also responsible for the structural and
thermal analysis of the CubeSat, 3D modelling, manufacturing, and assembly planning.
