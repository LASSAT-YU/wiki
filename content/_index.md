The Lassonde Satellite Club is the York University representative for the bi-annual Canadian Satellite Design
Competition ([CSDC](https://www.csdcms.ca/index.php/cubesat-design-challenge)). We provide students of all disciplines
an opportunity to develop hands on technical skills. Members learn how to design, prototype, test, and assemble a
cubesat (cube satellite). Students get experience working in software, RF communications, mechanical, electrical, and
ACS teams. LASSAT is an open learning environment for students of **all skill** levels and backgrounds. No prior skills
required.

See [about us](@/general/about.md) for more information and a list of frequently asked questions (faq).
