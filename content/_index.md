The Lassonde Satellite Club is the York University representative for the bi-annual Canadian Satellite Design
Competition (CSDC). We provide students of all disciplines an opportunity to develop hands on technical skills. Members
learn how to design, prototype, test, and assemble a cubesat (cube satellite). Students get experience working in
software, RF communications, mechanical, electrical, and ACS teams. LASSAT is an open learning environment for students
of **all skill** levels and backgrounds. No prior skills required.

See [about us](@/general/about.md) to get more general information about the club and frequently asked questions (faq).
