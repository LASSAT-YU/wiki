## Payload

Payload is all about the payload of the satellite, specifically for the last mission, it was an optical sensor (camera)
to observe specific spots on the Earth. The payload team is required to develop a payload module that will fulfill the
mission requirements as they relate to the payload. As a result, it is a multi-disciplinary team that needs to worry
about how the camera is going to observe the ground, how are will the camera be powered, what camera is going to be
selected, and so on. Most of those tasks are accomplished by the other teams, for example powering the camera... The
power is given by the electrical subsystem.
