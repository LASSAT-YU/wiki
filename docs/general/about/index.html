<p>The Lassonde Satellite Club is the York University representative for the bi-annual Canadian Satellite Design
Competition (CSDC). We provide students of all disciplines an opportunity to develop hands on technical skills. Members
learn how to design, prototype, test, and assemble a cubesat (cube satellite). Students get experience working in
software, RF communications, mechanical, electrical, and ACS teams. LASSAT is an open learning environment for students
of <strong>all skill</strong> levels and backgrounds. No prior skills required.</p>

<p>An all teams meeting is held weekly on Thursdays at 17:30 Toronto time in PSE 315 (Petrie Science &amp; Engineering
Building). Link to building on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/UpWuJCXdNrzHszAYA">Google maps</a>.
If you are unable to attend in person you may also attend on our discord, we will open a connection to the
meeting-voicechat for those that are not able to make it in person. A discord event will usually be created and can be
found at the top of all the channels. If you are unable to join on microphone or want to share something during the
meeting, feel free to write it in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/340255767087284224/743200432796467202">meeting-chat</a> (

<p>There are 6 teams (1 per subsystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/acs/"><strong>Attitude Control System (ACS)</strong></a> Monitors and adjusts a satellite's orientation while in orbit.
Usually, a CubeSat ACS consists of reaction wheels and magnetorquers.</li>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/communications/"><strong>Communications</strong></a> Responsible for uplink and downlink between the CubeSat and ground
stations, antenna design, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/electrical/"><strong>Electrical</strong></a> Printed circuit board (PCB) design, solar panel array design, power budgets,
etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/mechanical/"><strong>Mechanical</strong></a> Structural and thermal analysis of the CubeSat, 3D modelling, manufacturing,
and assembly planning.</li>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/payload/"><strong>Payload</strong></a> Varies based on the project. In previous CSDC missions there were payloads meant to
take optical, atmospheric, and other forms of data.</li>
<li><a href="https://lassat-yu.github.io/wiki/software/"><strong>Software</strong></a> Programs the on-board computer (OBC) and all other software needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>More information can be found in the section of the wiki for each subsystem and also fee free to ask question on
discord.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-canadian-satellite-design-competition-csdc">What is the Canadian Satellite Design Competition (CSDC)?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-canadian-satellite-design-competition-csdc">&#xE732;</a></h2>
<p>The Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (<a href="https://www.csdcms.ca/index.php/cubesat-design-challenge">CSDC</a>) is a
Canada-wide competition for teams of
university students (undergraduate and graduate) to design and build a small satellite. The satellites will undergo full
launch and space environmental qualification testing, with the goal of launching the winning satellite into orbit in
order to conduct scientific research. The CSDC is an innovative and academically-challenging initiative which will
advance space education in Canada, inspire students to pursue science and engineering educations and careers, and
prepare tomorrow’s leaders with the interdisciplinary teamwork skills which are necessary for success. (See more at
their site here: <a href="https://www.csdcms.ca/">https://www.csdcms.ca/</a>)</p>
<p>Previously, LASSAT put all of its effort towards the CSDC. In the past year, we've decided that we want to be a student
hub for CubeSat design at Lassonde, helping new and current students succeed in the space industry. We are always
looking for new CubeSat projects to work on while training members with workshops covering all aspects of CubeSat
design. Participating (and winning) in the CSDC is still a priority of ours.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-offer-training-to-new-members">Do you offer training to new members?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#do-you-offer-training-to-new-members">&#xE732;</a></h2>
<p>YES! We run workshops throughout the year on various aspects of CubeSat design. Don't worry if you're new or un-familiar
with satellite design, all the Team Leads started in the same position as you did!</p>
<h2 id="will-these-skills-and-opportunities-help-me-find-a-job-in-the-space-industry">Will these skills and opportunities help me find a job in the space industry?&nbsp;<a class="anchor" href="#will-these-skills-and-opportunities-help-me-find-a-job-in-the-space-industry">&#xE732;</a></h2>
<p>100%. CubeSats are becoming more and more common the canadian space industry and abroad. LASSAT gives you the
opportunity to put your knowledge to use by designing and doing hands-on work for CubeSats. We regularly get feedback
from Lassonde professors (such as Hugh Chesser) who are veterans of the space industry. We use industry-standard
software in our CubeSat design that will help prepare you for industry. In addition, while participating in the CSDC our
members have visited many canadian space industry partners, including ABB, Magellan, and more!</p>

<p>Here is a list including some software we use and teach students about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systems Tool Kit (<a href="https://www.agi.com/products/stk">STK</a>)</strong> used at countless companies to perform orbital,
communications, solar, and other forms of analysis, they have
a <a href="https://www.agi.com/training-and-certification#cert">free certification program</a> we recommend people check
out! <a href="https://www.library.yorku.ca/binaries/Steacie/phys4350/InstructSTK10.pdf">Instructions</a> to Install VPN client
and STK software for Lassonde students.</li>
<li><strong>Siemens NX</strong> Computer-aided design (CAD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) application commonly used in the space
industry to perform structural and thermal analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Altium Designer</strong> Circuit board design application we use to design our solar arrays and other circuit boards.</li>
<li>Hands-on skills such as Soldering, Manufacturing, and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/JBCdZRm">discord</a>, and let us know what you are interested in, and we'll help you find
somewhere to contribute. Don't worry about not having previous experience it's not a requirement, we are all here to
learn and develop. Feel free to check out as many subsystems as you like to find what interests you.</p>
